# Net Worth Calculator

The **Net Worth Calculator** is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that allows users to register and log in using JWT-based authentication. Once authenticated, users can input detailed assets and liabilities via REST APIs to calculate their net worth. The application provides a rich interface for calculating financial information and includes comprehensive unit testing for the backend using Jest and Supertest.


## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: For fast build tooling and development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first CSS styling.
- **Axios**: For making API requests to the backend.
- **React Router**: For routing and navigation between pages.
- **Headless UI & Heroicons**: For accessible and customizable UI components.

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: As the runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: For building the RESTful API.
- **MongoDB**: For storing user data, assets, liabilities, and net worth calculations.
- **Mongoose**: For object data modeling (ODM) with MongoDB.
- **JWT**: For secure user authentication and session management.
- **bcryptjs**: For password hashing and security.
- **Jest & Supertest**: For backend unit and integration testing.


## Features

- **User Authentication**:
  - Secure user registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
  - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for enhanced security.
  - JWT tokens are used for authentication and authorization.

- **Net Worth Calculation**:
  - Users can input detailed financial information, including various assets and liabilities.
  - Real-time calculation of net worth based on user inputs.
  - Supports a wide range of asset and liability types for comprehensive financial tracking.

- **RESTful APIs**:
  - **Authentication APIs**:
    - **POST /api/auth/register**: Register a new user.
    - **POST /api/auth/login**: Authenticate and obtain a JWT token.
  - **User APIs**:
    - **GET /api/user/profile**: Retrieve user profile information.
  - **Net Worth APIs**:
    - **POST /api/networth**: Submit assets and liabilities for net worth calculation.
    - **GET /api/networth**: Fetch calculated net worth data.

- **Responsive User Interface**:
  - Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design.
  - Intuitive UI/UX for ease of use across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

- **Protected Routes**:
  - Certain pages, such as the dashboard, are accessible only to authenticated users.
  - Uses React Router for client-side routing and navigation.

- **Unit Testing**:
  - Backend unit and integration tests are implemented using Jest and Supertest.
  - Ensures the reliability and correctness of API endpoints and application logic.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Graceful error handling for user input validation, API errors, and authentication issues.
  - Provides user-friendly error messages and feedback.

- **Data Security**:
  - Sensitive data is stored securely in MongoDB.
  - JWT tokens are used to protect user sessions and restrict access to authenticated users only.

- **Deployment Ready**:
  - The application is designed for easy deployment on cloud platforms such as Vercel (frontend) and Render.com (backend).
